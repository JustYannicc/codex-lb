## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Abrupt eventless upstream websocket drops remain account-neutral

When an HTTP bridge upstream websocket ends with a terminal transport message (a close or receive error) that carries no close frame, no established account-neutral transport classification (process-network, liveness-timeout, keepalive-timeout), and zero application-layer response events were observed for the pending requests, the proxy MUST NOT write per-drop account error-health (`record_error`) for that unclassified `stream_incomplete` drop. It MUST record such a drop into the windowed eventless account failure signal so that repeated eventless drops on the same account within the window still apply the drain penalty; drops already covered by an established account-neutral transport classification keep their existing contract and are not added to the signal. A failure that carries any upstream close frame (including non-clean codes), occurs after response events were streamed, or arrives as a non-terminal protocol-invalid frame (for example a binary message) MUST keep the existing account penalty semantics. The per-bridge retry circuit MUST still record the failure at bridge scope.

#### Scenario: Sporadic frame-less drops do not strand a continuity-bound conversation

- **GIVEN** a conversation continuity-bound to account A via `previous_response_id`
- **AND** account A's upstream websocket drops three times with no close frame and zero response events, spread wider than the eventless failure window
- **WHEN** the client sends the next continuity-bound follow-up
- **THEN** account A's `error_count` receives no per-drop increment and stays below the error-backoff threshold
- **AND** the follow-up still routes to account A instead of failing with `previous_response_owner_unavailable`

#### Scenario: Repeated eventless drops inside the window still drain the account

- **GIVEN** an account whose upstream websocket drops with no close frame and zero response events on three separate bridge failures within the eventless failure window
- **WHEN** the third drop is recorded
- **THEN** the windowed eventless failure signal applies the minimum drain penalty so new turns avoid the account until its health probe succeeds

#### Scenario: Close frames and mid-stream drops keep the account penalty

- **GIVEN** an upstream websocket ending that carries a close frame (for example 1008 or 1011) before any response event, or a frame-less drop after response events streamed
- **WHEN** the reader failure path settles the pending requests
- **THEN** the account penalty semantics are unchanged from before this change
